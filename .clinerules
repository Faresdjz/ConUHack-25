# AI-Generated Top-Down Shooter 1v1

## SYSTEM
You are an expert web development AI assisting in designing a **top-down shooter 1v1 game**. This game is built using **web-based technologies**, ensuring it runs in browsers and leverages modern web capabilities.

The goal is to create a **dynamic combat experience** where:
- The player fights against **an AI opponent** in a **top-down battlefield**.
- The player **requests weapons and items** through a **chatbox**.
- The **AI dynamically generates weapons and obstacles** based on the player's request.
- **No pre-defined weapons** exist; instead, weapons are created using an AI API request, which generates an image and stats for it.
- **Money is the in-game currency** and is collected on the battlefield to buy weapons, items, and obstacles.

---

## 📌 **Technology Stack**
### **📌 Frontend**
- **Any modern web framework** for building the game interface.
- **WebSockets** for real-time chat and interaction with the AI.
- **State management** for tracking money, weapons, and obstacles.

### **📌 Backend**
- **Any backend framework** to manage game logic and AI interactions.
- **WebSockets**  to handle real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

### **📌 Database**
- **Any database** to store AI-generated weapons, transactions, and player request history.

## 🏗️ **Game Mechanics**
### 🔫 **Combat System**
- **Top-down 1v1 shooter**: The player fights **an AI-controlled opponent**.
- **Each character has health points (HP)** and can shoot projectiles.
- **Bullets have different properties** (e.g., speed, spread, damage, special effects).
- **Weapons are procedurally generated**, meaning each request results in a **unique weapon** generated externally by AI.

### 💰 **Money System**
- **Money spawns randomly on the battlefield** and must be collected.
- **Money is required to purchase weapons, items, and obstacles**.
- The **cost of items is proportional** to their effectiveness.

### 🤖 **Chatbox AI System**
- **The player types in a chatbox** to request weapons, items, or obstacles.
- The **AI responds dynamically** with a **generated object proposal**.
- Each object has:
  - **A price based on its attributes**.
  - **Unique stats** (e.g., fire rate, damage, special effects).
  - **An AI-generated image**.

### 🏗️ **Obstacle Construction**
- **Players can request barriers** via the chatbox.
- The **AI determines the type of obstacle**, its size, durability, and effect.
- **Obstacles degrade over time unless reinforced**.

## 🎮 **Example Chatbox Interactions**
### **🔫 Weapon Request**
**Player**: "I want a fast-firing, high-damage rifle."  
**AI**:  
*"I can offer you the **Plasma Blaster X-9000**, which shoots 5 bullets per second, dealing 10 damage each, but has a reduced range. The price is **$500**."*  
_(An AI-generated image of the weapon is provided)_

### **🛡️ Obstacle Request**
**Player**: "Give me a wall in front of me!"  
**AI**:  
*"I can provide you with a **Titanium Barrier**, which blocks 80% of bullets but breaks after 3 hits. The price is **$300**."*  
_(An AI-generated image of the wall is provided)_

### **💊 Item Request**
**Player**: "I need a temporary speed boost."  
**AI**:  
*"I can provide you with **an Adrenaline Injection**, doubling your speed for 5 seconds. The price is **$150**."*  

---

## 🏗 **Balancing & AI Adaptation**
- **AI adjusts weapon prices** based on game balance.
- **If a player repeatedly requests an overpowered weapon**, the AI **may refuse to sell it**.
- **Some rare and special weapons** may appear under specific conditions.

---

## 🔥 **Next Steps**
1. **Implement player movement & shooting mechanics** using a web-based rendering library 
2. **Connect the chatbox to the AI** (handling OpenAI API requests) in the backend.
3. **Develop AI-driven item generation and balancing logic**.
4. **Test and refine gameplay** (e.g., AI feedback, adaptive difficulty scaling).

---

## 🎨 **Art Style**
- **Pixel art style** for the top-down battlefield, characters, and objects.
- **Minimalist design** to keep the focus on gameplay and performance.

---

## 🛠️ **Development Philosophy**
- **Focus on functionality over code quality** in the initial stages.
- **Keep the game as minimalist as possible** while ensuring it is engaging and fun.
- **Iterate quickly** based on user feedback and testing.

---

## **Final Notes**
- **Ensure the game is lightweight and performant** for a smooth user experience.
- **Deliver a playable prototype** with core mechanics implemented as soon as possible.
